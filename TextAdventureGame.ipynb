    "    Drawbacks:\n",
    "    1. If to approach formally, the game contains more than five stages, \n",
    "    though some of them are preparatory, very short and take no more than several seconds to choose an action. \n",

    "    Possible improvements:\n",
    "    1. Limit the maximum bet in a Dice game, or introduce requirements for mandatory bet increases.\n",
    "    2. Add an opportunity to face a gang of robbers, if the winning is very large.\n",
